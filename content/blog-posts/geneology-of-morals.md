If you ask data folks what they think of Excel, there are two acceptable answers. The first is rank contempt. It’s a bloated bundle of bad practices and antipatterns, the disease that won’t go away, the interminable termites in the foundation, the [crumbling hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBpiXcyB7wU&t=542s) on which our entire society hangs. The second answer is that Excel is software’s greatest achievement. It’s the ultimate Swiss Army knife; a perfectly designed cockroach; antifragile, manifest.

There is no third answer. In some warped version of the midwit meme, savvy observers live on the extremes, and only fools—”I like Excel, but I don’t think there’s anything special about it”—occupy the seemingly reasonable middle ground.

In my view, Excel is an unqualified triumph, for one very particular reason: It’s given more than a billion people direct access to the profound power of computers.

Of course, it’s hardly controversial to say that computers are powerful tools. But to most people, myself included, that power is abstract and confusing. It’s the incomprehensible reach of Google, [finding 4.9 billion records](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+does+google+work&oq=how+does+google+work&aqs=chrome..69i57.2479j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) in less than a second. It’s the impossible precision of rocket science, blasting barn silos to the edge of space, and landing them, upright, on a tiny target in the desert. It’s the magic of hardware itself, which can somehow turn bits of metal and silicon scattered across my house into words on my screen, and then words on another screen in Thailand, milliseconds later.

In contrast, Excel shows us something much more relatable—the power of automating simple arithmetic.

Consider a simple everyday application of Excel: Planning a party for the Super Bowl [big game](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/1/31/18202037/super-bowl-53-ads-trademark-the-big-game-2019). You might start by listing everyone who’s coming. Excel counts how many people are on your list, so you can immediately decide how many bags of chips to buy. If some people want to invite their friends, you can easily add them, and Excel updates the tally. You add what food people are bringing, and input how much money each person spent; Excel can now tell you how much money each person should chip in. If a few friends don’t drink, you can tweak the math to discount the cost of beer from their contributions. Last minute cancellations are no problem either; just remove people from the list, and all the numbers immediately get recomputed.

None of this math is hard to do; it could be done just as easily by a middle schooler as a sophisticated piece of software. But it’s _irritating_ to do. Excel provides a solution: Write a few formulas—a simple program—and have a computer do the arithmetic for us. In that, Excel isn’t valuable because it does something that’s incomprehensible; it’s valuable because it does something that’s easily understandable, over and over, at incomprehensible speed.

While we could write programs to do the same thing in any number of languages, the genius of Excel is in its interface. Excel doesn’t force people to learn an entire language, but it doesn’t discourage them from writing code either; instead, _it makes the code they write remarkably efficient._ By embedding all of the computational logic in spreadsheet cells, Excel’s users don’t have to worry about variable assignment or object definition, much less much knottier things like development environments or package dependencies. They just enter their numbers, and write simple formulas to manipulate them.

This efficiency disguises what Excel really is: An interface for writing programs. In doing so, hundreds of millions of people who wouldn’t call themselves programmers became programmers, and Excel formulas became the [most widely used code in the world.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/lambda-the-ultimatae-excel-worksheet-function/#:\~:text=Excel%20formulas%20are%20written%20by%20an%20order%20of%20magnitude%20more%20users%20than%20all%20the%20C%2C%20C%2B%2B%2C%20C%23%2C%20Java%2C%20and%20Python%20programmers%20in%20the%20world%20combined.) And Excel, which at first glance is little more than a calculator running on a loop,[1](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-next-billion-programmers?s=r#footnote-1) turned into a limitless platform for automation, capable of planning parties, creating personal budgets, and modeling entire businesses and industries.

# Automate anything

If Excel is for automating arithmetic, more traditional programming languages are for automating anything on the internet. You can collect [data from Twitter](https://benn.substack.com/p/twitter-profile-pictures). You can clean up a [century of baseball box scores](https://benn.substack.com/p/a-season-without-bats). You can send emails, reformat messy files, start your [vacuum cleaner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roomba-sdk), feed your [cat](https://petlibro.com/collections/automatic-pet-feeder), order a [Range Rover](https://www.ebay.com/itm/384685967273?hash=item59911207a9:g:V7AAAOSwXdlh5tJw), check your [flight status](https://aviationstack.com/), and digitally stamp your exclusive ownership of a reference to a link to a jpeg of a [single green pixel](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/23438849716378104815337549082155974522842134269864614386264898953977958236161).[2](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-next-billion-programmers?s=r#footnote-2)

There is, as a matter of both convenience and genuine influence, enormous power in doing these things automatically. By figuring out how to search for tweets programmatically, I was able to fix my strategy for playing Wordle.[3](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-next-billion-programmers?s=r#footnote-3) By writing a script that would automatically find promising candidates and send them messages on LinkedIn, a friend of mine became many times more productive as a recruiter and changed the course of his career.\[[4](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-next-billion-programmers?s=r#footnote-4)

These examples, unfortunately, are the exception. Both my friend and I work in the tech industry, and were surrounded by others who could inspire us to search for these sorts of automations. Most people aren't so lucky. They don't have the examples to emulate that we did, or teammates who they could learn from.
